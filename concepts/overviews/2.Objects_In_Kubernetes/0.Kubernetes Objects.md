# 📦 Kubernetes Objects - Summary

## 🔍 What Are Kubernetes Objects?

Kubernetes objects are the **core entities** that represent the **desired state** of your cluster. These objects describe:

- What applications (containers) are running and where
- What resources those applications have access to
- Policies that control how those applications behave (e.g., restart policies, upgrades, fault tolerance)

Think of Kubernetes objects as a **"record of intent"** — once created, Kubernetes constantly ensures the current state of the system matches this intent.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. **Desired State vs. Current State**
- **spec** → Desired state (what you want to happen)
- **status** → Current state (what is actually happening)

**Example:**
If you define a Deployment with `replicas: 3`, Kubernetes will keep 3 Pods running. If one crashes, Kubernetes replaces it to match the desired state.

---

### 2. **Working with Kubernetes Objects**

You interact with objects using:

- **Kubernetes API** (direct or via client libraries)
- **`kubectl` CLI** → Sends API calls to Kubernetes

To create, modify, or delete objects, you use YAML or JSON manifest files and apply them via `kubectl`.

## 📄 Example Manifest File (Deployment)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Create the object:
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
**Output:**
```
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment created
```

## 🛠 Required Fields in a Manifest

| Field         | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apiVersion`  | API version to use (e.g., `apps/v1`)                                        |
| `kind`        | Type of object (e.g., `Deployment`, `Pod`, `Service`)                       |
| `metadata`    | Identifiers like `name`, `UID`, `namespace`                                 |
| `spec`        | Desired configuration/state for the object                                  |

## 🧩 Object Hierarchy Example

### Deployment Spec Includes:
- Number of replicas
- Template for Pods
- Pod template includes:
  - Container details (image, port, etc.)

### StatefulSet Spec Includes:
- Same kind of spec field, but tailored to StatefulSet needs (e.g., stable network IDs, ordered Pod creation)

**📌 Each Kubernetes object type has a different `spec` and `status`. Always refer to the [Kubernetes API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/) for details.**

## ✅ Server-Side Field Validation (Since Kubernetes v1.25)

Helps catch typos or mistakes in your manifest before creating objects.

### Validation Levels (used with `--validate` flag in `kubectl`):

| Level     | Behavior                                                               |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `strict`  | Errors if validation fails                                              |
| `warn`    | Shows warnings but still proceeds                                      |
| `ignore`  | Disables validation                                                    |
| `true`    | Same as `strict`                                                       |
| `false`   | Same as `ignore`                                                       |

If API server supports validation (v1.25+), `kubectl` uses server-side validation. Otherwise, it falls back to client-side validation.

- **Annotations** (attach non-identifying metadata)
- **Field Selectors** (filter objects by field)
- **Finalizers** (control object deletion)
- **Owners and Dependents** (track relationships between objects)
- **Recommended Labels** (follow best practices)
