# 📘 Kubernetes Leases – Detailed Summary

In distributed systems, **leases** are used to manage **shared resources** and coordinate activity between multiple system components. In Kubernetes, this concept is implemented via **`Lease` objects** under the API group: `coordination.k8s.io`.

---

## 🔐 What is a Lease?

A **Lease** is like a **time-limited lock** used for coordination. In Kubernetes, `Lease` objects help:

1. Track **node health (heartbeats)**.
2. Manage **leader election**.
3. Track **API server identities**.
4. Enable coordination in **custom workloads**.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases of Lease in Kubernetes

---

### ✅ 1. Node Heartbeats

- Each **Node** has a **Lease object** in the `kube-node-lease` namespace.
- This Lease has the **same name as the Node**.
- The **kubelet updates** the `spec.renewTime` field of its Lease to send a **heartbeat**.
- The **control plane reads this timestamp** to decide if the node is healthy or has failed.

> 💡 **Example**: Node named `worker-node-1` has a Lease named `worker-node-1` in the `kube-node-lease` namespace. Kubelet updates this Lease every few seconds.

---

### 👑 2. Leader Election

Used to ensure **only one active instance** of a component (like a controller) is running at a time.

- Common for HA (high availability) components like:
  - `kube-controller-manager`
  - `kube-scheduler`
- Others stay on **standby** while the leader holds the Lease.

> 💡 **Example**: In a cluster with 3 `kube-scheduler` pods, only one will hold the Lease and be active; others will wait for the Lease to expire to take over if needed.

---

### 🆔 3. API Server Identity

> 🧪 **Feature State**: Beta in Kubernetes v1.26+ (enabled by default)

Each `kube-apiserver` instance **publishes its identity** using a Lease:

- Located in the `kube-system` namespace.
- Named as `apiserver-<sha256-hash>` (hash is based on the hostname).
- Helps to know **how many API server instances** are running.
- Useful for **future features** needing coordination.

You can inspect them with:

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system get lease -l apiserver.kubernetes.io/identity=kube-apiserver
```

> 💡 **Example Output**:
```text
NAME                                        HOLDER                                                                           AGE
apiserver-07a5ea9b9b072c4a5f3d1c3702        apiserver-07a5ea9b9b072c4a5f3d1c3702_0c8914f7-0f35-440e-8676-7844977d3a05        5m33s
apiserver-7be9e061c59d368b3ddaf1376e        apiserver-7be9e061c59d368b3ddaf1376e_84f2a85d-37c1-4b14-b6b9-603e62e4896f        4m23s
apiserver-1dfef752bcb36637d2763d1868        apiserver-1dfef752bcb36637d2763d1868_c5ffa286-8a9a-45d4-91e7-61118ed58d2e        4m43s
```

To get details of a specific Lease:

```sh
kubectl -n kube-system get lease apiserver-<hash> -o yaml

apiVersion: coordination.k8s.io/v1
kind: Lease
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-02T13:16:48Z"
  labels:
    apiserver.kubernetes.io/identity: kube-apiserver
    kubernetes.io/hostname: master-1
  name: apiserver-07a5ea9b9b072c4a5f3d1c3702
  namespace: kube-system
  resourceVersion: "334899"
  uid: 90870ab5-1ba9-4523-b215-e4d4e662acb1
spec:
  holderIdentity: apiserver-07a5ea9b9b072c4a5f3d1c3702_0c8914f7-0f35-440e-8676-7844977d3a05
  leaseDurationSeconds: 3600
  renewTime: "2023-07-04T21:58:48.065888Z"

```

> 💡 **Important Notes**:
- If a new API server uses the **same hostname**, it **takes over** the existing Lease.
- Old Lease entries from removed API servers are **garbage collected after 1 hour**.
- You can **disable this feature** using the `APIServerIdentity` feature gate.

---

### 👷‍♂️ 4. Workloads and Custom Controllers

Your **custom workloads** (like controllers or apps) can also use `Lease` objects for internal coordination.

#### Use Cases:
- Implement **leader election** among replicas.
- Ensure **only one active instance** performs certain tasks.

#### Best Practices:
- Use meaningful Lease names, e.g., `example-foo` for a component `Example Foo`.
- To avoid conflicts when deploying multiple instances, use:
  - Unique **name prefix**
  - A **hash** of the deployment name, etc.

> 💡 **Example**:  
If you deploy a custom app `custom-processor`, your Lease name could be `custom-processor-abc123`.

---

## 📝 Summary Points for Exam

- Kubernetes uses `Lease` objects to manage coordination tasks.
- Node heartbeats update a `Lease` with `renewTime`; control plane checks node health using this.
- Leader election uses Leases to ensure only one active instance.
- API server identity is tracked using Leases (since v1.26), enabling advanced coordination.
- Custom workloads can implement their own Leases for leader election and coordination.
- Always use meaningful and unique names to avoid Lease conflicts.

---

## ✅ Final Exam Tip

**Remember the key namespaces**:
- `kube-node-lease` → Node heartbeats.
- `kube-system` → API server Leases.

And **important fields** in Lease:
- `spec.holderIdentity`
- `spec.renewTime`
- `leaseDurationSeconds`
