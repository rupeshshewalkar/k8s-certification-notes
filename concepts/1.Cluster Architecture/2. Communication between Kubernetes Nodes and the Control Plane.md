# 📡 Communication between Kubernetes Nodes and the Control Plane

This guide explains how different components in a Kubernetes cluster communicate, with a focus on securing those communications, especially in environments using public or untrusted networks.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Kubernetes follows a **hub-and-spoke API model**, where:

- The **API server is the hub**.
- Nodes and pods act as **spokes** that communicate **only with the API server**.
- No other control plane component is exposed to remote services directly.

---

## 🔁 Communication Paths

### 1. **Node ➝ Control Plane (API Server)**

- All node and pod requests go **only to the API server**, typically over **HTTPS (port 443)**.
- **Authentication & Authorization**:
  - Must be enabled to protect against unauthorized access.
  - Especially important if **anonymous access** or **service account tokens** are used.
  
#### 🔐 Node Security Setup

- Nodes should have the **public root certificate** of the cluster.
- Nodes should use **valid client credentials**, typically in the form of **client certificates**.
- Use **kubelet TLS bootstrapping** for automated setup of these credentials.

#### 📦 Pod Access to API Server

- When a pod starts, Kubernetes injects:
  - A **public root certificate**
  - A **bearer token** (via service account)
- Pods access the API server through the virtual `kubernetes` service in the **default namespace**.
  - This service routes via `kube-proxy` to the **API server's HTTPS endpoint**.

#### ✅ Outcome

- By default, this setup is **secure** and can operate over **public or untrusted networks**.

---

### 2. **Control Plane ➝ Node**

Two types of communication:
1. **API Server ➝ Kubelet**
2. **API Server ➝ Node / Pod / Service (via proxy)**

---

#### 📞 API Server ➝ Kubelet

- Used for:
  - **Fetching pod logs**
  - **Attaching to pods** (e.g., via `kubectl exec`)
  - **Port forwarding**

- **Connection Details**:
  - Goes to the **kubelet's HTTPS endpoint**.
  - **By default**, the API server **does NOT verify** the kubelet's certificate.
    - This opens the door to **man-in-the-middle attacks**.
    - Not safe over public networks.

##### 🔐 Securing the Connection

- Use `--kubelet-certificate-authority` flag to make the API server **verify kubelet’s certificate**.
- Alternatively, set up **SSH tunneling** to securely connect to kubelet (see below).
- Also enable **kubelet authentication and authorization** for additional protection.

---

#### 🌐 API Server ➝ Nodes / Pods / Services (via proxy)

- **By default**, these use **plain HTTP**:
  - No encryption
  - No authentication
- You can use `https://` to **encrypt traffic**, but:
  - Certificate validation is **not enforced**.
  - No **client credentials** are provided.

⚠️ **Still unsafe** for untrusted or public networks.

---

## 🔒 SSH Tunnels (Deprecated)

- Previously used to secure communication **from control plane to nodes**.
- API server opens SSH tunnel to each node (`port 22`) and sends traffic through it.
- Example: All traffic to kubelet, pod, or service routes through this tunnel.

**⚠️ Deprecated**: Only use if absolutely necessary.

---

## 🔄 Konnectivity Service (Recommended Replacement)

> 📌 *Feature State: Beta since Kubernetes v1.18*

### 🔧 What It Does

- Acts as a **TCP-level proxy** between the control plane and the cluster.
- Replaces the need for SSH tunnels.

### 🧱 Architecture

- **Konnectivity Server**: Runs in the **control plane network**.
- **Konnectivity Agents**: Run on the **nodes**, initiate connections to the server, and maintain them.

All control-plane-to-node traffic passes securely through these maintained connections.

➡️ **Follow the official [Konnectivity setup guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/)** to enable it.

## 🧠 Summary to Remember for Exams

| Path | Direction | Default Security | Recommended Practice |
|------|-----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Node ➝ API Server | Secure (HTTPS) | Use client certs & tokens | ✅ Secure by default |
| Pod ➝ API Server | Secure (via service account) | Tokens & cert auto-injected | ✅ Secure by default |
| API Server ➝ Kubelet | Not secure (by default) | Use cert verification or SSH | ⚠️ Needs securing |
| API Server ➝ Node/Pod/Service | Not secure (plain HTTP) | Use HTTPS (but no validation) | ⚠️ Still not safe |
| SSH Tunnel | Control Plane ➝ Node | Secure but deprecated | ⚠️ Avoid unless required |
| Konnectivity | Control Plane ➝ Node | Secure via agents | ✅ Recommended |

## 📝 Example: When Pod Talks to API Server

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: default
```

When this pod starts:
- It receives:
  - `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt` (root cert)
  - `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` (bearer token)
- It can make a secure request to `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
