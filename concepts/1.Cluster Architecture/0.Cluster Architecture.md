# 📘 Kubernetes Cluster Architecture Summary

## 🧠 What is a Kubernetes Cluster?

A **Kubernetes cluster** is made up of two main parts:

- **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster
- **Worker Nodes**: Run your containerized applications inside Pods

> 📌 **At least one worker node** is required to run your applications (Pods).

## 🧱 Basic Components

### 🎛️ Control Plane Components

The **control plane** is the brain of Kubernetes. It makes decisions like scheduling and reacting to events.

Main control plane components:

| Component | Role | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **kube-apiserver** | The front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. Exposes the Kubernetes API. | Users or tools interact with this to manage the cluster. |
| **etcd** | A highly-available key-value store for all cluster data. | Stores config data like node status, Pod specs. Make sure to back it up! |
| **kube-scheduler** | Chooses which node a Pod should run on based on resource needs, constraints, etc. | If a new Pod is created, scheduler picks an appropriate node. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Runs controller loops to watch and act on cluster state. | Node Controller, Job Controller, etc. See below. |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | Integrates cloud-specific logic (only in cloud-based clusters). | Creates cloud load balancers, manages cloud routes, etc. |

#### 🔄 Types of Controllers (within kube-controller-manager)

- **Node Controller**: Detects node failures
- **Job Controller**: Runs Pods for one-off tasks
- **EndpointSlice Controller**: Maps Services to Pods
- **ServiceAccount Controller**: Creates default accounts in namespaces

> 🧠 Think of controllers like "automation bots" watching resources and taking action.

### 🧑‍💻 Node Components

These run **on every node** (worker or control plane) to manage container workloads.

| Component | Role | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **kubelet** | Ensures containers in Pods are running and healthy | If a Pod crashes, kubelet restarts it. |
| **kube-proxy** (optional) | Maintains network rules to route traffic to Pods | Supports Services for internal/external access |
| **Container Runtime** | Manages container lifecycle (start, stop, delete) | containerd, CRI-O, Docker (deprecated) |

---

## 🧩 Addons (Optional but Common)

Addons provide **cluster-level features** and usually run in the `kube-system` namespace.

| Addon | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **DNS** | Essential for service discovery in the cluster (e.g., `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) |
| **Dashboard (Web UI)** | Web interface to monitor and manage the cluster |
| **Container Resource Monitoring** | Tracks CPU/memory usage, stores metrics |
| **Logging** | Centralized logging for troubleshooting container logs |
| **Network Plugins** | Implements CNI (Container Network Interface) for Pod networking |

## ⚙️ Deployment Options for Control Plane

| Deployment Style | Description | Example |
|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Traditional** | Runs on VMs as systemd services | Manual setup or scripts |
| **Static Pods** | Runs as static Pod definitions on specific nodes | Used by `kubeadm` |
| **Self-hosted** | Runs as Pods managed by Kubernetes itself | Hosted inside the cluster |
| **Managed Services** | Cloud providers manage control plane | E.g., GKE, EKS, AKS |

## 📍 Workload Placement Considerations

- **Small/dev clusters**: Control plane and app Pods may share nodes
- **Production clusters**: Control plane and worker nodes are separate
- **Some orgs**: Run monitoring tools/addons on control plane nodes

---

## 🔧 Cluster Management Tools

- **kubeadm**: Easy bootstrap tool
- **kops**: Production-grade tool for AWS
- **Kubespray**: Ansible-based deployment across clouds

Each offers a different way to **deploy and manage** clusters.

## 🧬 Customization & Extensibility

Kubernetes is **highly flexible**:

| Customization Area | Example |
|--------------------|---------|
| **Schedulers** | Add custom schedulers alongside default |
| **API Extensions** | Use CRDs (CustomResourceDefinitions) |
| **Cloud Integration** | Use cloud-controller-manager for deep cloud integration |

> 🛠️ You can fine-tune your cluster to fit business needs, manage complexity, and optimize performance.
