# 🧩 Mixed Version Proxy in Kubernetes

> **Feature State:** Kubernetes `v1.28` (Alpha)  
> **Default:** Disabled  
> **Introduced in:** Kubernetes `v1.33`

## 🧠 What is Mixed Version Proxy?

The **Mixed Version Proxy** is a new **alpha feature** that allows one **Kubernetes API server** to **proxy resource requests** to **peer API servers** within the same cluster.

This is especially useful when you're:
- Running **multiple kube-apiservers** with **different Kubernetes versions**
- Performing a **long-lived Kubernetes upgrade** or rollout

### ✅ Main Benefit:
It helps **avoid 404 Not Found errors** that users might see during an upgrade process by ensuring the request gets routed to an API server that **can handle the requested API resource**.

---

## 🛠️ Why is this Important?

During Kubernetes upgrades:
- Not all API servers may support all resources (some APIs may be removed/added across versions).
- Users might get errors if a request hits an API server that doesn’t recognize a specific resource.

With **Mixed Version Proxy**:
- Resource requests are **routed to a peer API server** that knows how to handle them.
- This makes **highly available** and **safe cluster upgrades** possible.

### 📘 Example:

Imagine you're upgrading from Kubernetes 1.27 → 1.33:
- You have some resources (like `batch/v1/jobs`) that are available only in the newer version.
- Older kube-apiservers (like v1.27) don't support `batch/v1/jobs`.
- Mixed Version Proxy will **forward** such requests to newer API servers that do support the resource.

---

## ⚙️ How to Enable Mixed Version Proxy

To enable this feature, set the `UnknownVersionInteroperabilityProxy` **feature gate** to `true` when starting your `kube-apiserver`.

```bash
kube-apiserver \
--feature-gates=UnknownVersionInteroperabilityProxy=true \
--peer-ca-file=/path/to/kube-apiserver-ca.crt \
--proxy-client-cert-file=/path/to/proxy-client.crt \
--proxy-client-key-file=/path/to/proxy-client.key \
--requestheader-client-ca-file=/path/to/requestheader-ca.crt \
--requestheader-allowed-names=""
```

### ✅ Optional (but useful) flags:
```bash
--peer-advertise-ip=<IP to be used by peers to reach this API server>
--peer-advertise-port=<Port to be used by peers to reach this API server>
```

If `--peer-advertise-ip` and `--peer-advertise-port` are **not set**, fallback options:
1. `--advertise-address`
2. `--bind-address`
3. Default host IP

---

## 🔐 Authentication Between API Servers

### ✅ Source API Server:
- Uses `--proxy-client-cert-file` and `--proxy-client-key-file` to **authenticate** itself to the peer.

### ✅ Destination API Server:
- Verifies the incoming peer connection using `--requestheader-client-ca-file`

### ✅ Source server must trust destination:
- You must set `--peer-ca-file` with the **CA bundle** of the peer's serving certificates.

---

## 🔗 Peer Connectivity Configuration

To let peer API servers know how to reach each other, configure:
- `--peer-advertise-ip`
- `--peer-advertise-port`

If not set, fallbacks used:
- `--advertise-address`
- `--bind-address`
- Host's default network interface

## 🔁 Mixed Version Proxying Behavior

### 🔍 How it works:
1. If an API server receives a **request it cannot serve** (due to version incompatibility or API being disabled),
2. It uses the **StorageVersion API** to:
   - Check which **peer API servers** can handle that **resource**.
   - **Proxies the request** to a matching peer API server.

### 🔁 Flow Summary:
| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| API server can serve the resource | Handles request locally |
| No `StorageVersion` found for resource | If configured, proxies to **extension API server** |
| Valid `StorageVersion` found, but API disabled | Proxies to **peer API server** that supports it |
| No known peer for the resource | Returns `404 Not Found` |
| Peer selected but unresponsive | Returns `503 Service Unavailable` |

---

### 📘 Example Request Flow:

- Request: `GET /batch/v1/jobs/my-job`
- Old API server (v1.27): `batch/v1` API is **disabled**
- It checks peers using `StorageVersion` info.
- Finds a newer peer (e.g., v1.33) that supports `batch/v1`.
- Proxies the request to that peer.
- If successful: user gets correct response.
- If peer fails to respond: returns `503 Service Unavailable`.

---

## 🧬 Under the Hood (StorageVersion API)

- Every resource has a `StorageVersion` entry.
- API server checks `StorageVersion` to see:
  - Whether it can serve the request
  - Or whether a peer is available to handle it

---

## ❌ What if Something Goes Wrong?

| Situation | Error Code |
|-----------|------------|
| No API server can serve the request | `404 Not Found` |
| Peer server is down or unreachable | `503 Service Unavailable` |

---

## 🧾 Summary

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **What** | Allows one API server to proxy requests to another peer |
| **Why** | Helps during upgrades when API versions differ between servers |
| **Benefit** | Avoids user-facing `404` errors |
| **Enable** | Set `--feature-gates=UnknownVersionInteroperabilityProxy=true` |
| **Auth** | Mutual TLS + request header verification |
| **Routing** | Uses StorageVersion API to find the right peer |
| **Fallbacks** | Returns `404` if unknown, `503` if peer unreachable |

---

## 📌 Things to Remember for Exam

- Mixed Version Proxy is **alpha in v1.33**.
- Enables **API servers of different versions** to **cooperate** during upgrades.
- Uses **StorageVersion** to determine capability of peers.
- Handles requests **gracefully** without exposing internal upgrade state to users.
- Uses **certificates and request headers** for secure peer communication.
- Proxying only kicks in when **API is missing or disabled** on the local server.
