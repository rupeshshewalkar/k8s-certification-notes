# 📦 Kubernetes Garbage Collection - Full Summary

## 🚀 What is Garbage Collection in Kubernetes?

**Garbage Collection** is a set of automatic cleanup mechanisms that Kubernetes uses to delete unused or obsolete resources. This helps maintain cluster health and frees up system resources.

### 🧹 Resources Cleaned Up by Garbage Collector:

- ✅ Terminated Pods  
- ✅ Completed Jobs  
- ✅ Unused Containers and Container Images  
- ✅ PersistentVolumes with `reclaimPolicy: Delete`  
- ✅ Expired or stale CertificateSigningRequests (CSRs)  
- ✅ Nodes deleted via:
  - Cloud Controller Manager (cloud setup)
  - Addon (on-premise setup)
- ✅ Node Lease objects  
- ✅ Orphaned Kubernetes objects (no owner reference)

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Ownership & Owner References

Kubernetes uses **owner references** to track which objects are "parents" and which are "dependents."

### 🔗 Example:

If a **ReplicaSet** creates **Pods**, then:

- Pods will have an `ownerReference` pointing to the ReplicaSet.
- When the ReplicaSet is deleted, Kubernetes knows it should also delete the Pods.

### ⚠️ Important Notes on Owner References:

- **Cross-namespace owner references are not allowed.**  
  For example:
  - A Pod in `namespace-a` can't be owned by an object in `namespace-b`.

- **Cluster-scoped dependents** can only have **cluster-scoped owners**.

- From **v1.20+**, invalid references trigger a warning:
  ```sh
  kubectl get events -A --field-selector=reason=OwnerRefInvalidNamespace
  ```

## 🔄 Cascading Deletion (Auto-deletion of dependents)

When you delete a parent object, Kubernetes can also delete its dependents automatically. This is called **Cascading Deletion**, and it comes in two types:

### 1. 🌐 Foreground Deletion

- The parent object stays visible until all its dependents are deleted.
- The object is marked for deletion using:
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    deletionTimestamp: <time>
    finalizers:
      - foregroundDeletion
  ```

✅ Used when you want to **wait until dependents are deleted first**.

### 2. 🧯 Background Deletion (Default)

- The parent object is deleted immediately.
- Kubernetes deletes the dependents **in the background**.
- Controlled using **finalizers**.

### 🧸 Orphaned Dependents

You can **choose not to delete** dependents by using the `--cascade=orphan` option when deleting a parent.

```sh
kubectl delete replicaset my-replicaset --cascade=orphan
```

## 🗑️ Garbage Collection of Unused Containers and Images

Managed by **kubelet**, which runs on each node.

### ⏲️ Frequency:

- **Unused containers**: Cleaned every **1 minute**
- **Unused images**: Cleaned every **5 minutes**

> ❌ Avoid using external GC tools — they may interfere with kubelet behavior.

### 🛠️ Kubelet Configuration:

Garbage collection is configured using the `KubeletConfiguration` resource.

#### Key Parameters:

| Parameter              | Purpose                                                   | Example Value |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `imageMaximumGCAge`    | Max age an image can remain unused (K8s v1.30+)           | `12h45m`      |
| `MinAge`               | Minimum age before a container is GC'ed                   | `5m`          |
| `MaxPerPodContainer`   | Max dead containers per Pod                               | `1`           |
| `MaxContainers`        | Max dead containers in the whole node                     | `100`         |
| `HighThresholdPercent` | Disk usage threshold to trigger image cleanup             | `85`          |
| `LowThresholdPercent`  | Target disk usage after cleanup                           | `70`          |

> ⚠️ If kubelet restarts, `imageMaximumGCAge` timer resets.

### 🧠 Example:

Suppose:

- `imageMaximumGCAge` is set to `12h`
- An image was last used 13 hours ago
- Disk is not full

✅ It will be garbage collected because it crossed the 12-hour threshold, regardless of disk usage.
