# ⚙️ cgroup v2 in Kubernetes

---

## 📌 What are cgroups?

On **Linux**, **control groups (cgroups)** are used to **constrain and manage system resources** (like CPU, memory) allocated to **processes**.  
In Kubernetes, both the **kubelet** and **container runtime** (like containerd, CRI-O) use cgroups to enforce:
- **CPU and memory limits**
- **Requests for containers and pods**

---

## 📖 Two Versions of cgroups

- **cgroup v1**: Legacy version, had **multiple hierarchies** for each resource type.
- **cgroup v2**: New generation of the cgroup API with a **unified design** and better capabilities.

> 🆕 Kubernetes supports **cgroup v2 as stable since v1.25**.

## 🚀 What is cgroup v2?

cgroup v2 is a **modern, unified control system** that improves resource management across all Linux workloads.

### ✅ Key Improvements over cgroup v1

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unified Hierarchy** | All controllers (CPU, memory, IO, etc.) use a single hierarchy. |
| **Safe Sub-tree Delegation** | More secure delegation of control to containers. |
| **Pressure Stall Information (PSI)** | Helps observe CPU/memory/IO pressure (like bottlenecks). |
| **Better Isolation** | Stronger resource isolation between containers. |
| **Advanced Memory Accounting** | Tracks different types of memory (kernel, network, etc.) in detail. |
| **Handles Slow Resource Changes** | Detects changes like page cache writebacks more accurately. |

> 📘 **Example**:  
With PSI, if a container is stuck waiting on I/O, the system can detect and report that stall, enabling smarter scheduling or debugging.

## 🎯 Use in Kubernetes

Some Kubernetes features require cgroup v2.  
Example:
- **MemoryQoS**: Enhances memory quality of service using cgroup v2 primitives.

## ⚙️ Requirements to Use cgroup v2

To enable and run Kubernetes with cgroup v2, you must ensure:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ✅ Linux Kernel | Version **5.8 or later** |
| ✅ OS Support | The OS must **enable cgroup v2** |
| ✅ Container Runtime | Must support cgroup v2 |
| ✅ Cgroup Driver | `systemd` cgroup driver must be used by both **kubelet** and **container runtime** |

### Supported Runtimes
- **containerd**: v1.4+
- **CRI-O**: v1.20+

---

## 🐧 Supported Linux Distributions

The following distros **enable cgroup v2** by default (or provide a way to enable it):

| OS | Version |
|----|---------|
| **Ubuntu** | 21.10+ (Recommend 22.04+) |
| **Debian** | 11 (Bullseye) |
| **Fedora** | 31+ |
| **Arch Linux** | Since April 2021 |
| **RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux** | RHEL 9+ |
| **Container Optimized OS** | M97+

---

## 🔍 How to Check if cgroup v2 is Enabled

Run this command on your node:

```bash
stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup/
```

- If the result is: `cgroup2fs` → ✅ **cgroup v2**
- If the result is: `tmpfs` → ❌ **cgroup v1**

---

## 🛠️ How to Enable cgroup v2 Manually (if needed)

1. Edit the GRUB file:

   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/default/grub
   ```

2. Add this to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`:
   ```
   systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1
   ```

3. Update GRUB:
   ```bash
   sudo update-grub
   sudo reboot
   ```

> 🔔 **Note**: Recommended way is to use a distro that supports cgroup v2 by default.

---

## 🔁 Migrating to cgroup v2

- Once you upgrade to a **supported kernel**, Kubernetes will **automatically detect** and use cgroup v2.
- No manual changes are needed in kubelet or container runtime config.
- **User experience will remain the same**, unless:
  - You're accessing the cgroup filesystem directly.
  - You're using tools that depend on cgroup v1.

---

## ⚠️ Considerations While Migrating

Applications or agents that directly access the cgroup filesystem **must be updated** to versions that support cgroup v2.

### 📌 Examples of tools that need updates

| Tool / App | Required Version |
|------------|------------------|
| **cAdvisor** (for monitoring) | `v0.43.0+` |
| **OpenJDK** / HotSpot | `jdk8u372`, `11.0.16`, `15+` |
| **IBM Semeru** | `8.0.382.0`, `11.0.20.0`, `17.0.8.0+` |
| **IBM Java** | `8.0.8.6+` |
| **uber-go/automaxprocs** | `v1.5.1+` |

> 🧠 **Example**:  
If you run Java apps on a node using cgroup v2, using an older JDK may not report memory/cpu limits correctly. Use updated JVM versions for proper support.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **cgroup v2** offers a unified, safer, and more powerful way to manage system resources in Kubernetes.
- Required for advanced features like **MemoryQoS**.
- Supported in Kubernetes **v1.25+** (stable).
- Make sure your **Linux distro, kernel, runtime, and monitoring tools** support it.
- Use the `stat` command to check your system’s cgroup version.
- Avoid manually enabling unless necessary—prefer distros with cgroup v2 enabled by default.
