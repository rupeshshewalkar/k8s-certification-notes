# 🌩️ Cloud Controller Manager - Kubernetes

**Feature State**: Kubernetes v1.11+ (Beta)

## 📌 What is Cloud Controller Manager?

The **cloud-controller-manager** is a key Kubernetes control plane component that contains **cloud-specific logic**. It integrates Kubernetes clusters with **cloud providers** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) and separates Kubernetes-specific functions from cloud-specific ones.

> 💡 **Why it exists?**  
To allow Kubernetes to run on **any cloud** (public, private, or hybrid) without being tightly coupled to a particular provider.

---

## 🧱 Design & Architecture

- Runs in the **control plane**, often as **replicated Pods**.
- Contains **multiple controllers** inside a **single process**.
- Uses a **plugin-based architecture** to support different cloud providers.
- Can be deployed as a **Kubernetes addon** if not embedded in the control plane.

## 🔧 Main Controllers Inside Cloud Controller Manager

### 1. 🧑‍💻 Node Controller

Handles nodes when they're created or deleted in the cloud.

**Responsibilities**:
- Update Node object with server’s **unique ID** from the cloud.
- Add **labels** and **annotations** (e.g., region, CPU, memory).
- Set **hostname** and **network addresses**.
- Check if a node is **unresponsive**, and remove it if it's been deleted in the cloud.

> 🔄 Some implementations split this into `node controller` and `node lifecycle controller`.

---

### 2. 🛣️ Route Controller

**Purpose**:
- Sets up **network routes** in the cloud.
- Ensures **pods across nodes can communicate**.

> 🧠 Example: Allocating pod network IP ranges and configuring subnet routes in GCP.

---

### 3. 🔁 Service Controller

**Purpose**:
- Connects Kubernetes Services to **cloud load balancers**, **IP addresses**, **health checks**, etc.

> 📘 Example: When you create a `Service of type LoadBalancer`, this controller tells AWS/GCP to create a load balancer.

## 🔐 Required Permissions (RBAC & Authorization)

### 🔹 Node Controller

**Access to**: `v1/Node`  
**Required Verbs**: `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `patch`, `watch`, `delete`

### 🔹 Route Controller

**Access to**: `v1/Node`  
**Required Verbs**: `get`

### 🔹 Service Controller

**Access to**: `v1/Service` and `v1/Service/status`  
**Required Verbs**:
- For reading: `list`, `get`, `watch`
- For updating: `patch`, `update`

### 🔹 Others

**Event Management**:
- `v1/Event`: `create`, `patch`, `update`

**Service Account Creation**:
- `v1/ServiceAccount`: `create`

## 📜 Sample ClusterRole (RBAC) for Cloud Controller Manager

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: cloud-controller-manager
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["events"]
  verbs: ["create", "patch", "update"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes"]
  verbs: ["*"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["nodes/status"]
  verbs: ["patch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services"]
  verbs: ["list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["services/status"]
  verbs: ["patch", "update"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["serviceaccounts"]
  verbs: ["create"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["persistentvolumes"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "update", "watch"]
```

## 🔍 Real-Life Example

> Let’s say you create a new Kubernetes cluster on AWS:
- AWS creates EC2 instances (nodes).
- The **node controller** updates Kubernetes Node objects with EC2 IDs.
- When you create a `LoadBalancer` Service, the **service controller** tells AWS to create an ELB.
- If one node is terminated from AWS, the **node controller** detects it and removes it from the Kubernetes cluster.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Decouples Kubernetes core logic from cloud-specific operations.
- Helps Kubernetes work with **any** cloud provider using plugins.
- Includes built-in controllers for **nodes**, **routes**, and **services**.
- Needs specific **RBAC permissions** to interact with Kubernetes objects and cloud APIs.
