# üìå Kubernetes Finalizers ‚Äî Complete Explanation with Examples

## ‚úÖ What Are Finalizers?

Finalizers are **namespaced keys** added to Kubernetes resources that **prevent the resource from being immediately deleted**. They ensure that some **cleanup or important action happens first**.

Think of finalizers as **"delete blockers"**. They act like a to-do list: Kubernetes won't delete the object until everything in the finalizers list is checked off.

---

## üîÑ How Do Finalizers Work?

When you delete a Kubernetes object that has a finalizer:

1. Kubernetes **does NOT delete the object right away**.
2. It **sets `.metadata.deletionTimestamp`** to mark it for deletion.
3. It **returns `202 Accepted` HTTP status** (meaning "Okay, delete has been scheduled").
4. The object now enters a **`Terminating` state**.
5. Kubernetes waits for the **controller** associated with the finalizer to do its work (e.g., cleanup).
6. Once the work is done, the **controller removes the finalizer** key from the object.
7. **Only when finalizers are all removed**, the object is fully deleted.

## üß† Example: PersistentVolume Protection

If you try to delete a PersistentVolume that's **still used by a Pod**, Kubernetes adds this finalizer:

```yaml
finalizers:
  - kubernetes.io/pv-protection
```

This blocks deletion until the Pod is no longer using the volume. Once the Pod stops using it, Kubernetes removes the finalizer, and the volume is deleted.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Finalizers in Manifests

You can manually add a finalizer in the manifest of any resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  finalizers:
    - example.com/my-custom-cleanup
```

This tells Kubernetes to **wait for the custom cleanup process** before deleting this Pod.

## üîÅ Finalizers vs Owner References vs Labels

| Feature | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Labels** | Grouping and selection | Pods created by a Job might share a label like `job-name=myjob` |
| **Owner References** | Point to the owner object | Pod created by a Job will have `ownerReferences` pointing to the Job |
| **Finalizers** | Prevent deletion until cleanup is done | Finalizer on a Volume to wait until it‚Äôs unused |

- Finalizers can also **block deletion of dependent resources**, even if the owner object is deleted.
- When deletion is stuck, you should **inspect both finalizers and owner references** to diagnose.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes and Limitations

- Once `.metadata.deletionTimestamp` is set, you **cannot change it**, and you **cannot add new finalizers**, only remove existing ones.
- The object **cannot be recovered** after deletion is requested. You must **create a new one**.
- **Avoid force-removing finalizers** unless you're absolutely sure it's safe. Removing them without completing cleanup can break your cluster.

## üß™ Example kubectl Behavior

### Deleting with Finalizers:

```bash
kubectl delete pod mypod
```

This marks the pod as terminating and starts the finalizer process.

### Stuck Object Example:

If a finalizer never gets removed (e.g., the controller is broken), the object will stay in a `Terminating` state **forever** unless:

```bash
kubectl patch pod mypod -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do this only if you‚Äôve verified cleanup is done manually.**

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases for Finalizers

- **Clean up external cloud resources** (e.g., deleting cloud load balancers)
- **Clean up CRDs** (Custom Resource Definitions) or dependent resources
- **Protect critical resources** (e.g., prevent deletion of active Volumes or Namespaces)

## üìö Summary

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Finalizers | Delay actual deletion of a resource |
| deletionTimestamp | Marks the start of deletion |
| Controller | Removes finalizers after doing cleanup |
| Terminating | The object is being deleted, but finalizers still exist |
| Manual cleanup | Sometimes needed if objects are stuck |
| Labels | For selection/grouping |
| Owner References | Track dependent objects for automatic cleanup |
| Example Finalizer | `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` for PersistentVolumes |
