# 📘 Kubernetes Object Management – Summary

Kubernetes supports **three main techniques** for managing objects using the `kubectl` command-line tool. Choosing the right technique depends on your environment (dev or prod), number of users, and complexity of use.

> ⚠️ **Important:** You should manage a Kubernetes object using **only one technique**. Mixing methods (e.g., `kubectl apply` and `kubectl replace`) on the same object can cause **unexpected behavior**.

---

## 🔧 1. Imperative Commands

- **What it does:** Directly applies changes to **live** objects in the cluster using one-line commands.
- **Best for:** Beginners, quick tasks, testing in development environments.
- **Learning curve:** Very low.
- **Writers:** Supports multiple users.
- **Command style:** One-liner actions (`create`, `delete`, `get`, etc.).

### ✅ Example
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```

This command instantly creates a Deployment running the nginx container.

### 📈 Pros
- Simple and fast for small, immediate changes.
- No config files needed.
- Ideal for learning and experimenting.

### 📉 Cons
- No audit trail or version history.
- No integration with Git or review systems.
- Changes are not reusable (no template).
- Hard to reproduce or share changes.

---

## 📄 2. Imperative Object Configuration

- **What it does:** Applies changes from a **YAML or JSON file**, but with explicit commands (`create`, `replace`, etc.).
- **Best for:** Single-user workflows in **production** environments.
- **Learning curve:** Moderate.
- **Writers:** Typically single user.

### ✅ Examples
Create from file:
```bash
kubectl create -f nginx.yaml
```

Replace live configuration:
```bash
kubectl replace -f nginx.yaml
```

Delete from multiple files:
```bash
kubectl delete -f nginx.yaml -f redis.yaml
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** `kubectl replace` **overwrites** the existing object. Any changes made outside the file (like auto-assigned IPs) may be lost.

### 📈 Pros
- Version-controlled files can be stored in Git.
- Supports change review, audit trail, and templates.
- Simpler than declarative for basic usage.
- More mature (since Kubernetes v1.5).

### 📉 Cons
- Requires writing YAML config files.
- You need to manually sync live changes back to the files.
- Not suited for managing multiple files or large configurations.

---

## 📂 3. Declarative Object Configuration

- **What it does:** Applies configuration files from a **directory**. Uses `apply` and `diff` to determine whether to create, patch, or delete objects.
- **Best for:** **Production** environments with **multiple users** and CI/CD systems.
- **Learning curve:** High.
- **Writers:** Supports multiple users.

### ✅ Examples
Apply all changes in a folder:
```bash
kubectl apply -f configs/
```

See the difference before applying:
```bash
kubectl diff -f configs/
```

Apply changes recursively:
```bash
kubectl apply -R -f configs/
```

### 📈 Pros
- Best integration with GitOps, CI/CD pipelines, and team collaboration.
- Retains live changes made by other tools or users.
- Auto-detects operations (create, update, delete).
- Operates on directories (bulk operations).

### 📉 Cons
- Harder to debug and understand when things go wrong.
- Partial updates involve complex patching and merging.
- Steeper learning curve due to the patch mechanism.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Technique                    | Operates On         | Best For             | Writers | Learning Curve |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Imperative commands**     | Live objects         | Dev, quick tasks     | 1+      | Lowest          |
| **Imperative object config**| Individual files     | Small prod use       | 1       | Moderate        |
| **Declarative object config**| Directories of files | Prod + CI/CD         | 1+      | Highest         |

## 🔁 How to Remember the Differences

| Command Style | Example Command                          | Key Behavior                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Imperative**| `kubectl create deployment nginx`         | Instant action, no config file     |
| **Imperative Config**| `kubectl create -f nginx.yaml`     | YAML required, replaces whole object |
| **Declarative**| `kubectl apply -f configs/`              | Directory-based, smart patching    |

## 🧠 Tip for Exams
If the question is about:

- **Fast action or learning →** Use **imperative commands**
- **Simple, single-user production setup →** Use **imperative object configuration**
- **Teamwork, GitOps, full CI/CD pipeline →** Use **declarative object configuration**
