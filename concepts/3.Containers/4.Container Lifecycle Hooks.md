# Container Lifecycle Hooks in Kubernetes

## Overview
Kubernetes provides **Container lifecycle hooks** that allow containers to run custom code when specific lifecycle events occur. These hooks are similar to lifecycle hooks in programming frameworks (e.g., Angular), and they enable containers to be aware of events like creation, termination, and other management actions. 

## Types of Container Hooks

1. **PostStart Hook**
   - **When**: Executes immediately after a container is created.
   - **Details**: This hook runs **after** the container is created, but there's no guarantee it will execute before the container's `ENTRYPOINT`. No parameters are passed to the handler.
   - **Example**: Running an initialization script when a container starts.

2. **PreStop Hook**
   - **When**: Executes right before the container is terminated (due to reasons like liveness probe failure, preemption, or resource issues).
   - **Details**: This hook must complete before the termination signal (TERM) is sent to the container. The termination grace period begins before the hook runs.
   - **Example**: Save application state or gracefully shut down services before the container stops.

3. **StopSignal**
   - **When**: Defines a custom stop signal that is sent to the container when it is stopped.
   - **Details**: Overrides any stop signal defined in the container image.
   - **Example**: You can configure a container to listen for a specific signal (e.g., SIGTERM or SIGINT) to trigger its shutdown process.

## Hook Handler Implementations

Handlers are the actions executed when hooks are triggered. There are three types of handlers you can implement:

1. **Exec**: Runs a specific command inside the container (e.g., `pre-stop.sh`). The containerâ€™s resources will be used by the executed command.
   - **Example**: Running a cleanup script before stopping the container.
   
2. **HTTP**: Sends an HTTP request to a specific endpoint within the container.
   - **Example**: Trigger a health check or notify a service before termination.
   
3. **Sleep**: Pauses the container for a specified duration. This feature is in beta, and you can configure a 0-second sleep for a no-op.
   - **Example**: Delay termination to ensure other processes are completed.

## Hook Execution Behavior

- **PostStart**: Triggered as soon as the container starts. If it hangs or takes too long, it can prevent the container from transitioning to a running state.
- **PreStop**: Must finish before the termination signal is sent. If it hangs or takes too long, the pod will remain in the `Terminating` phase until the grace period expires.

### Grace Period Example:
If a `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is set to 60 seconds, and the PreStop hook takes 55 seconds, the container will be killed after 60 seconds because the total execution time exceeds the grace period.

## Hook Delivery Guarantees
- **At Least Once Delivery**: Hooks are guaranteed to be delivered at least once. However, there may be rare cases where a hook is delivered multiple times, such as after a kubelet restart.
- **Example**: If an HTTP hook's endpoint is down, the hook will not be retried, but a restart of the kubelet may resend the hook.

## Debugging Hook Handlers
- If a handler fails, Kubernetes broadcasts an event. For example:
  - **PostStart Hook Failure**: `FailedPostStartHook`
  - **PreStop Hook Failure**: `FailedPreStopHook`
  
  **Example Output for Failed PostStart Hook**:
  ```text
  Warning  FailedPostStartHook  4s (x2 over 5s)  kubelet            Exec lifecycle hook ([badcommand]) for Container "lifecycle-demo-container" in Pod "lifecycle-demo_default" failed - error: command 'badcommand' exited with 126.
  ```

### Important Considerations:
- **Hook handlers should be lightweight** to avoid delays in lifecycle transitions.
- **Long-running commands** are acceptable when necessary, such as saving application state before stopping the container.

### Example Kubernetes Config for Hooks:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: example-image
    lifecycle:
      postStart:
        exec:
          command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello World"]
      preStop:
        exec:
          command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Goodbye World"]
```

This configuration triggers a `PostStart` hook to print "Hello World" when the container starts and a `PreStop` hook to print "Goodbye World" before the container stops.
