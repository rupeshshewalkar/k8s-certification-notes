# 📦 Kubernetes Container Images – Full Summary

## 🧾 What is a Container Image?

A **container image** is a **bundle** that includes:

- Your application
- Its dependencies
- Runtime environment expectations

Think of it like a **portable box** that has everything your app needs to run anywhere.

Before using it in a Pod, you typically:
1. **Build the image**
2. **Push it to a container registry**

---

## 🏷️ Image Names

### Basic Format:
```plaintext
[registry-host[:port]/]repo-name[:tag|@digest]
```

- **Image Name Only**:
  ```bash
  busybox
  # Kubernetes pulls from Docker Hub with the 'latest' tag
  ```

- **With Tag**:
  ```bash
  busybox:1.32.0
  ```

- **With Custom Registry and Tag**:
  ```bash
  registry.k8s.io/pause:3.5
  ```

- **With Digest**:
  ```bash
  registry.k8s.io/pause@sha256:abc123...
  ```

- **With Both Tag and Digest**:
  ```bash
  registry.k8s.io/pause:3.5@sha256:abc123...
  # Only the digest will be used to pull the image
  ```

### 🤖 Default Registry:
If no registry is specified, Kubernetes assumes it's from Docker Hub.

### ✅ Tags vs Digests:

| Feature | Tag | Digest |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Mutable | ✅ (can point to different image versions) | ❌ (fixed) |
| Human-friendly | ✅ | ❌ |
| Immutable | ❌ | ✅ |
| Example | `nginx:1.21.0` | `nginx@sha256:abc123...` |

💡 **Best practice**: Use **digests** or **specific tags (like `v1.0.0`)** in production. Avoid `:latest`.

---

## 🔁 Updating Images

When creating resources like Deployments, Kubernetes sets the **imagePullPolicy** for containers, affecting how often it tries to pull the image.

### 🚥 Image Pull Policy Options:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `IfNotPresent` (default) | Pulls image **only if it's not on the node** |
| `Always` | Pulls image **every time** the container is started |
| `Never` | **Never pulls** image; container fails if not already present locally |

💡 Even `Always` is efficient due to image layer caching.

---

## ⚠️ Warning on `:latest` Tag

Using `:latest`:
- Makes it hard to **track** versions.
- Complicates **rollback**.
- Can cause **mixed versions** if the tag content changes.

Instead, use:
```bash
image: myapp@sha256:<digest>
```

This ensures **consistent behavior** no matter what the registry changes.

---

## 🔄 Default Behavior of `imagePullPolicy`

| Situation | Resulting `imagePullPolicy` |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Tag is `:latest` | `Always` |
| Tag is omitted | `Always` |
| Digest is used | `IfNotPresent` |
| Custom tag is used (not `:latest`) | `IfNotPresent` |

🛠 **Note**: This is only set at creation. If the image tag changes later, you must update the `imagePullPolicy` manually.

---

## 🛠 Force Image Pull

To ensure a fresh pull every time:
1. Set `imagePullPolicy: Always`
2. Use `:latest` tag without specifying `imagePullPolicy`
3. Omit both tag and `imagePullPolicy`
4. Enable the `AlwaysPullImages` **admission controller**

---

## ❌ ImagePullBackOff – Common Error

If a container fails to start due to image issues (wrong name, private registry, etc.), Kubernetes may show:
```
Waiting: ImagePullBackOff
```

Kubernetes retries image pulls with increasing delay (up to 5 minutes).

---

## 🔄 Pulling Based on RuntimeClass (Alpha Feature)

Since **Kubernetes v1.29**, if you enable the `RuntimeClassInImageCriApi` feature gate:
- The kubelet pulls images based on both **image name** and **runtime handler**
- Useful for **VM-based containers** (e.g., Windows Hyper-V)

---

## 🔃 Serial vs Parallel Image Pulls

### 🚶 Default (Serial):
Kubelet pulls **one image at a time** per node.

### 🏃 Enable Parallel Pulls:
Set in kubelet config:
```yaml
serializeImagePulls: false
```

Now, kubelet can pull **multiple images in parallel** (but not within the same Pod).

### 📊 Max Parallel Pulls (Beta - v1.32):
Limit parallel pulls with:
```yaml
maxParallelImagePulls: <number>
```

✅ Must be ≥1  
✅ If ≥2, `serializeImagePulls` **must be** set to `false`

**Why limit?**  
To avoid overloading network or disk I/O.

## 🏗️ Multi-Architecture Images (Mentioned Briefly)

- Registries can serve image **indexes** that point to **multi-architecture** versions.
- Helps run the correct image for the system (e.g., `amd64` vs `arm64`).
Certainly! Here’s a continuation of the summary that covers the remaining points starting from **Multi-Architecture Images**:

---

### **Multi-Architecture Images with Image Indexes**

- A container registry can serve an **image index** in addition to the binary images. 
- The **image index** points to different **image manifests** for architecture-specific versions of the container. 
- This allows Kubernetes to fetch the appropriate image for the machine's architecture. 
- For example, an image like `pause` can be served with different versions (such as `pause-amd64` for older configurations) for compatibility.

---

### **Using a Private Registry**

- **Private registries** may require authentication to pull images.
- Credentials can be provided in several ways, including:
  1. **Configuring nodes to authenticate** to private registries, allowing all pods to read images from configured registries.
  2. Using the **Kubelet Credential Provider** to fetch credentials dynamically for private registries.
  3. **Pre-pulled images** are stored on the node, and all pods can use any cached images.
  4. **Specifying `ImagePullSecrets` on a pod** allows only certain pods to access the private registry by providing their own authentication keys.
  5. **Vendor-specific or local extensions** can be used if a custom mechanism for authenticating nodes to private registries is required.

---

### **Configuring Nodes to Authenticate to a Private Registry**

- To authenticate nodes to a private registry, follow the specific instructions for your chosen container runtime and registry.
- **Example**: You can refer to the "Pull an Image from a Private Registry" task to learn how to set up a private container image registry (such as Docker Hub).
- This ensures that the **Kubelet** (the agent managing the nodes) can authenticate and pull images from private registries.

---

### **Kubelet Credential Provider for Authenticated Image Pulls**

- The **Kubelet Credential Provider** is useful for dynamically fetching credentials for pulling images from private registries.
- This is a robust way to fetch credentials, often used with cloud providers where authentication tokens are short-lived.
- The **credential provider** can invoke a **plugin binary** to dynamically fetch credentials.
- Requires Kubelet-level configuration to enable this feature.

---

### **Interpretation of config.json**

- In **Docker**, the `auths` key in the **config.json** file can only specify root URLs.
- In **Kubernetes**, `config.json` supports both **glob URLs** and **prefix-matched paths**:
  - **Glob patterns** allow more flexible matching (e.g., `*.kubernetes.io`).
  - Examples:
    - `*.kubernetes.io` does **not** match `kubernetes.io` but matches `abc.kubernetes.io`.
    - `prefix.*.io` matches `prefix.kubernetes.io` but **not** `abc.kubernetes.io`.
  - A valid `config.json` file can look like:
    ```json
    {
        "auths": {
            "example.com": {
                "auth": "base64encodedcredentials"
            },
            "*.*.example.com": {
                "auth": "base64encodedcredentials"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
