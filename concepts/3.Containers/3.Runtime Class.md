# RuntimeClass in Kubernetes

The **RuntimeClass** feature in Kubernetes allows users to select the configuration for the container runtime to use when running a Pod's containers. It helps in balancing performance, security, and resource overhead.

### **Motivation**
You might need different container runtimes for different Pods to achieve a balance between:
- **Performance**: Using different runtimes can offer performance trade-offs.
- **Security**: Some runtimes provide better security, such as hardware virtualization, which increases isolation but adds overhead.

For example, if a Pod needs a high-security assurance, you can schedule it to run on a runtime with hardware virtualization for extra isolation, even though it might incur more resource overhead.

### **Setup**

To configure and use **RuntimeClass**, follow these steps:

#### 1. **Configure CRI Implementation on Nodes**
- **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)** configuration depends on the CRI implementation (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).
- By default, Kubernetes assumes **homogeneous node configuration**, meaning all nodes are configured the same way. To support heterogeneous nodes (different runtimes across nodes), refer to the scheduling mechanism below.

#### 2. **Create RuntimeClass Resources**
- For each runtime configuration, create a corresponding **RuntimeClass** resource. Each configuration has a **handler** name, which identifies the runtime setup.
- The **RuntimeClass** resource includes two main fields:
  - `metadata.name`: The name of the RuntimeClass.
  - `handler`: The name of the corresponding CRI configuration.
  
**Example RuntimeClass definition:**
```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: myclass
handler: myconfiguration
```
- **Note**: RuntimeClass resources should be restricted to cluster administrators.

### **Usage**

Once **RuntimeClass** is configured, specify the `runtimeClassName` in the **Pod spec** to instruct Kubernetes which runtime to use for the Pod.

**Example Pod definition:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  runtimeClassName: myclass
```
- If the specified **RuntimeClass** does not exist or cannot be run, the Pod will enter the **Failed** state.
- If no `runtimeClassName` is specified, the default runtime is used, which behaves like RuntimeClass is disabled.

### **CRI Configuration**
To configure CRI runtimes, different systems have different methods:

#### **containerd**
- Runtime handlers are configured in the `containerd` configuration file (`/etc/containerd/config.toml`).
- Handlers are configured under the `runtimes` section.
  
**Example**:
```toml
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.${HANDLER_NAME}]
```

#### **CRI-O**
- Runtime handlers are configured in the `CRI-O` configuration file (`/etc/crio/crio.conf`).
- Handlers are defined under the `crio.runtime.runtimes` table.
  
**Example**:
```toml
[crio.runtime.runtimes.${HANDLER_NAME}]
  runtime_path = "${PATH_TO_BINARY}"
```

### **Scheduling**

To ensure Pods using specific **RuntimeClasses** are scheduled on nodes that support them:
- Use the `nodeSelector` field in **RuntimeClass** to restrict nodes that are compatible with the runtime.
- The `nodeSelector` for the **RuntimeClass** is merged with the Pod's `nodeSelector` during admission, effectively taking the **intersection** of both.
- **Tolerations** can also be used to allow Pods to run on nodes with **taints**, ensuring that only specific Pods can use certain runtimes.

If there is a conflict (e.g., conflicting node selectors), the Pod will be rejected.

**Note**: See the Kubernetes documentation for more details on **nodeSelector** and **tolerations**.

### **Pod Overhead**

In Kubernetes v1.24 (stable), you can define **Pod overhead** in **RuntimeClass**. This is useful for accounting for additional resources used by the runtime, such as:
- Memory or CPU overhead due to the runtime configuration.

The **overhead** field in **RuntimeClass** allows you to specify the extra resources needed for Pods running with that runtime.

**Example RuntimeClass with overhead**:
```yaml
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: myclass
handler: myconfiguration
overhead:
  memory: "100Mi"
  cpu: "0.1"
```

This ensures the scheduler accounts for the overhead when allocating resources for Pods.

### **Summary**
- **RuntimeClass** allows specifying different container runtimes for Pods, offering a balance between performance and security.
- It requires configuring the container runtime interface (CRI) on nodes and creating corresponding **RuntimeClass** resources.
- You can specify the **runtimeClassName** in the Pod spec to use a particular runtime.
- **Scheduling** helps ensure Pods with specific RuntimeClasses are scheduled on appropriate nodes, and **Pod overhead** ensures that the extra resources used by a runtime are accounted for.
