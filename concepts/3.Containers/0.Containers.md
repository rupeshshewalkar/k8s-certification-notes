# 📦 Containers in Kubernetes: Explained for Exam Preparation

## ✅ What is a Container?

- A **container** is a lightweight, portable package that bundles an **application** with **everything it needs to run**:
  - Application code
  - Runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js)
  - System libraries
  - Dependencies
  - Configuration files or default settings

> 📌 **Think of it like** a shipping container that holds everything needed for a product to be delivered — no matter the ship or port (i.e., OS or cloud provider).

---

## 🌀 Importance of Container Terminology

- The term **"container" is overloaded** – it can mean different things (like Docker containers, Linux containers, or OCI containers).
- Always **confirm the meaning** when discussing with someone else to avoid confusion.

---

## 🔁 Repeatability and Consistency

- **Repeatable Execution**: Every time you run a container, you get **the same behavior**, regardless of the environment.
- This standardization comes from having all dependencies included in the image.

> 📌 **Example**: If you develop an app on your laptop in a container, it will work the same way on a cloud VM or Kubernetes node.

---

## 🔗 Decoupling from Host OS

- Containers **decouple** the application from the host operating system.
- This makes it easy to **run the same app on different environments**, such as:
  - Ubuntu or CentOS servers
  - AWS, Azure, or GCP

---

## 🧱 Containers in Kubernetes

- In Kubernetes, **each Pod contains one or more containers**.
- All containers in a Pod:
  - Are **co-located** (on the same node)
  - Are **co-scheduled** (scheduled together)
  - Share the same network namespace and volumes

> 📌 **Example**: A web app container and a log sidecar container in the same Pod can communicate using `localhost`.

---

## 🖼️ What is a Container Image?

- A **container image** is a **blueprint** or template used to create containers.
- It includes:
  - Code
  - Runtime (e.g., JRE for Java)
  - Application and system libraries
  - Default environment variables

> 📌 Example: A Node.js web app image might include:
> - Node.js runtime
> - `app.js` file
> - `node_modules` folder
> - `package.json`

---

## 🔒 Stateless and Immutable Containers

- Containers are **stateless** (don’t store permanent data inside) and **immutable** (don’t change after starting).
- If changes are needed:
  1. **Build a new image** with the changes
  2. **Delete the old container**
  3. **Create a new container** using the updated image

> ⚠️ Don’t "edit" running containers — always build and redeploy.

---

## ⚙️ Container Runtime

- A **container runtime** is the software that actually runs containers.
- Kubernetes supports container runtimes like:
  - `containerd`
  - `CRI-O`
  - Any runtime that implements the **Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface)**

---

## 🎛️ RuntimeClass in Kubernetes

- By default, the cluster chooses a runtime.
- If needed, use **`RuntimeClass`** to:
  - Run **different Pods with different container runtimes**
  - Run **same runtime with different settings**

> 📌 **Example**: 
> - Use `gvisor` runtime for security-sensitive workloads.
> - Use default `containerd` for general apps.

## 📝 Key Takeaways

| Concept | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| **Container** | Package of app + dependencies, consistent behavior everywhere |
| **Image** | Blueprint to create containers |
| **Stateless** | Containers don’t save permanent data inside |
| **Immutable** | Don’t change containers directly – rebuild instead |
| **Runtime** | Tool responsible for running containers (e.g., `containerd`) |
| **RuntimeClass** | Choose specific runtime or runtime config per Pod |
