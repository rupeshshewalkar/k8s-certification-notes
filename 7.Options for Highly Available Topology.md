# 🧠 Summary: Options for Highly Available Topology in Kubernetes (via `kubeadm`)

When setting up a **Highly Available (HA) Kubernetes cluster**, `kubeadm` offers **two main topologies**:

---

## **1. Stacked etcd Topology (Default in kubeadm)**

### ✅ What it is:
- Both **control plane components** and **etcd** run **on the same nodes**.
- Each **control plane node** runs:
  - `kube-apiserver`
  - `kube-controller-manager`
  - `kube-scheduler`
  - A **local etcd member**

### ✅ How it works:
- **Local etcd** talks **only** with the local `kube-apiserver`.
- All control planes are behind a **load balancer** for workers to access the API.

### ✅ Advantages:
- ✅ **Simpler setup** — no need to manage separate etcd hosts.
- ✅ **Easier replication** — everything is colocated.
- ✅ **Automatically used** by `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join --control-plane`.

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- ❌ **Coupled failure risk** — if one node fails, **both etcd and control plane** go down.
- ❌ **Redundancy compromised** in case of node failure.

### ✅ Recommendation:
- Run **at least 3 control plane nodes** to avoid losing quorum and redundancy.

### 📘 Example Visual:
```
Control Plane Node 1  ─┬─ kube-apiserver
                      ├─ controller-manager
                      ├─ scheduler
                      └─ etcd (local)

Control Plane Node 2  ─ same components as Node 1
Control Plane Node 3  ─ same components as Node 1
```

---

## **2. External etcd Topology**

### ✅ What it is:
- **etcd runs on separate nodes**, independent of control plane nodes.
- Control plane nodes do **not run local etcd**.

### ✅ How it works:
- All control plane nodes:
  - Still run `kube-apiserver`, `controller-manager`, `scheduler`
  - Communicate with **external etcd nodes**
- All `kube-apiserver` instances use a **load balancer** for availability.
- Each **etcd member** talks with all `kube-apiserver` instances.

### ✅ Advantages:
- ✅ **Better fault isolation** — losing one node (etcd or control plane) doesn't affect the other.
- ✅ **More resilient** than stacked topology.

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- ❌ **More complex setup**
- ❌ **Requires more nodes** (minimum 6):
  - At least **3 control plane nodes**
  - At least **3 etcd nodes**

### 📘 Example Visual:
```
etcd Node 1 ─┐
etcd Node 2 ─┼── Communicate with all control plane API servers
etcd Node 3 ─┘

Control Plane Node 1 ─ kube-apiserver, scheduler, controller-manager
Control Plane Node 2 ─ same
Control Plane Node 3 ─ same
```

## 🔎 Important Notes

- `kubeadm` **bootstraps etcd statically** (refer to etcd clustering guide for deeper understanding).
- For **external etcd**, you **must set it up manually** and configure `kubeadm` accordingly.
- You need to evaluate:
  - How critical uptime and fault tolerance are
  - How many nodes you can afford/manage

## ✅ Quick Comparison Table

| Feature                    | **Stacked etcd**                        | **External etcd**                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Control Plane & etcd      | Same node                               | Separate nodes                            |
| Default with `kubeadm`    | ✅ Yes                                   | ❌ No (requires manual setup)             |
| Simplicity                | ✅ Easier                                | ❌ More complex                           |
| Resilience                | ❌ Risk of double failure                | ✅ Better isolation of failures           |
| Minimum nodes required    | 3 (control plane with etcd)             | 6 (3 control plane + 3 etcd)              |
| Suitable for small setups | ✅ Yes                                   | ❌ Not ideal                              |
| Setup effort              | Low                                     | High                                      |

## 📝 Summary for Exams

- Two HA topologies in `kubeadm`: **stacked etcd** and **external etcd**
- **Stacked** is simpler but has a risk: losing a node affects etcd **and** control plane
- **External** provides better redundancy, but requires **more nodes** and **complex setup**
- Always have **at least 3 nodes** in either etcd or control plane to maintain quorum
- `kubeadm` **defaults to stacked topology** unless configured otherwise
