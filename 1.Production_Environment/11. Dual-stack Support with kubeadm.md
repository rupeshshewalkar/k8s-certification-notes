# üìò Dual-stack Support with `kubeadm`

> **Feature state**: Stable since Kubernetes **v1.23**

Dual-stack networking allows a Kubernetes cluster to use **both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses**. This means each **Pod** and **Service** can have both an **IPv4** and **IPv6** address assigned. Useful for compatibility and future-proofing.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

### 1. **Install `kubeadm`**
- You must install `kubeadm` first by following the official installation steps.

### 2. **Enable IPv6 Packet Forwarding on All Nodes**
- Run the following to **check** if IPv6 forwarding is enabled:
  ```bash
  sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding
  ```
  - If it returns `1`, it's already enabled.
  - If not, enable it by running:
    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 1
    EOF

    sudo sysctl --system
    ```

### 3. **Assign IP Ranges**
- You need:
  - A valid **IPv4 CIDR range** (e.g., `10.244.0.0/16`)
  - A valid **IPv6 CIDR range**, typically from `2000::/3` (e.g., `2001:db8:42:0::/56`)
- These do **not** need to be publicly routable; internal-only ranges are fine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating a Dual-stack Cluster

You can create a dual-stack cluster in two ways:

### **Option 1: Using `kubeadm init` CLI flags**
```bash
kubeadm init \
  --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16,2001:db8:42:0::/56 \
  --service-cidr=10.96.0.0/16,2001:db8:42:1::/112
```

### **Option 2: Using a `kubeadm` config file**

Example `kubeadm-config.yaml`:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
kind: ClusterConfiguration
networking:
  podSubnet: 10.244.0.0/16,2001:db8:42:0::/56
  serviceSubnet: 10.96.0.0/16,2001:db8:42:1::/112
---
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
kind: InitConfiguration
localAPIEndpoint:
  advertiseAddress: "10.100.0.1"
  bindPort: 6443
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
  - name: "node-ip"
    value: "10.100.0.2,fd00:1:2:3::2"
```

Run the command:
```bash
kubeadm init --config=kubeadm-config.yaml
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: `--apiserver-advertise-address` supports only **one** IP, not both IPv4/IPv6.

---

## üîó Joining Nodes to the Cluster

Before joining, ensure:
- Node has a routable **IPv6 interface**
- IPv6 forwarding is enabled

### **Join a Worker Node**

Example `kubeadm-config.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
kind: JoinConfiguration
discovery:
  bootstrapToken:
    apiServerEndpoint: 10.100.0.1:6443
    token: "clvldh.vjjwg16ucnhp94qr"
    caCertHashes:
    - "sha256:..."
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
  - name: "node-ip"
    value: "10.100.0.2,fd00:1:2:3::3"
```

Join command:
```bash
kubeadm join --config=kubeadm-config.yaml
```

---

### **Join Another Control Plane Node**

Example `kubeadm-config.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
kind: JoinConfiguration
controlPlane:
  localAPIEndpoint:
    advertiseAddress: "10.100.0.2"
    bindPort: 6443
discovery:
  bootstrapToken:
    apiServerEndpoint: 10.100.0.1:6443
    token: "clvldh.vjjwg16ucnhp94qr"
    caCertHashes:
    - "sha256:..."
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
  - name: "node-ip"
    value: "10.100.0.2,fd00:1:2:3::4"
```

## üîÅ Creating a Single-stack Cluster with Dual-stack Enabled

If you don't need both IPv4 and IPv6, you can still create a **single-stack cluster** with dual-stack capability turned on.

Example config:
```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
kind: ClusterConfiguration
networking:
  podSubnet: 10.244.0.0/16
  serviceSubnet: 10.96.0.0/16
```

This means:
- You can use IPv4 only (or IPv6 only), but still have the option to switch to dual-stack later.
- You're just not assigning both families at runtime.

---

## üìå Key Notes to Remember

- **IPv6 forwarding** is **required** on all nodes.
- `--apiserver-advertise-address` only supports **one** IP (not both).
- You cannot change **cluster CIDRs** or **service CIDRs** using `kubeadm upgrade`.
- **Node CIDR mask sizes** (IPv4/IPv6) can be tuned via:
  - `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4`
  - `--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6`
- You still need a CNI plugin (like Calico or Cilium) that supports dual-stack.
- Config files give **more flexibility** and **clarity** than CLI arguments.

## üì¶ Example

Let‚Äôs say you're building a cluster for a telco company. They need IPv6 for future 5G devices, but also need IPv4 for legacy systems.

- Use dual-stack setup
- Assign IPv4 for internal workloads, IPv6 for external API traffic

This setup helps them transition smoothly from IPv4 to IPv6 without full migration pressure.
