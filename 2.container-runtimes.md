Container Runtimes in Kubernetes (v1.32 and beyond)
🚨 Important Note

    Dockershim has been removed starting from Kubernetes v1.24.

    You cannot use Docker directly anymore like before.

    Kubernetes now requires a container runtime that supports the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

🧱 What is a Container Runtime?

A container runtime is software installed on each node of a Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for:

    Running containers.

    Interacting with the kubelet to manage pods.

✅ Supported Container Runtimes (Post Dockershim)

    containerd – Lightweight and widely used.

    CRI-O – Designed specifically for Kubernetes.

    Docker Engine (Only via cri-dockerd adapter now)

    Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR) – Commercial version, uses cri-dockerd as well.

⚙️ CRI (Container Runtime Interface)

    It’s an API that container runtimes must support to talk with Kubernetes.

    Kubernetes 1.32 requires runtimes to support CRI v1.

        Older versions fallback to v1alpha2 (deprecated).

    Make sure your runtime supports CRI v1 for compatibility.

🛜 Network Configuration (Important for Pods to Communicate)

By default, Linux blocks IPv4 forwarding.

You must enable it manually if your CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin doesn’t do it automatically.

How to enable IPv4 forwarding:

```cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF
sudo sysctl --system
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward   # Should show 1
```

🧩 Cgroup Drivers – Critical for Resource Management

Cgroups (Control Groups) manage CPU/memory resources for containers.
Both the kubelet and container runtime must use the SAME cgroup driver.
🔘 Two Types of Cgroup Drivers:

    cgroupfs – Default in kubelet.

    systemd – Recommended when using systemd init system (most Linux distros use it).

⚠️ Why Matching Cgroup Drivers is Important

If kubelet uses cgroupfs and the system uses systemd, it causes resource instability (especially under load).

Solution: Use systemd as the cgroup driver in both:

    kubelet

    container runtime

✅ Example kubelet configuration:

```apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
cgroupDriver: systemd
```
🛑 WARNING:

If a node has already joined the cluster and created pods, don’t just change the cgroup driver.
➡️ Best practice: Recreate the node with the new configuration.
🔧 Runtime-Specific Configuration Examples
1. containerd

Installation:

    Follow containerd installation guide.

    Config file: /etc/containerd/config.toml

    Default CRI socket: /run/containerd/containerd.sock

To enable systemd cgroup driver:

[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".containerd.runtimes.runc.options]
  SystemdCgroup = true

To override pause image:

[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
  sandbox_image = "registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10"

Commands:

containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml
sudo systemctl restart containerd

2. CRI-O

    Default CRI socket: /var/run/crio/crio.sock

    Uses systemd cgroup driver by default (✅ good).

To switch to cgroupfs (not recommended unless needed):

[crio.runtime]
conmon_cgroup = "pod"
cgroup_manager = "cgroupfs"

Override pause image:

[crio.image]
pause_image="registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10"

Apply config changes:

systemctl reload crio

3. Docker Engine (with cri-dockerd)

    🛑 Docker doesn’t support CRI.
    ✅ Use cri-dockerd (adapter to bridge Docker and Kubernetes).

    CRI socket: /run/cri-dockerd.sock

Steps:

    Install Docker.

    Install cri-dockerd from its GitHub repo.

    Configure kubelet to use cri-dockerd.

Override pause image: Use command line argument:

--pod-infra-container-image=registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10

4. Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR)

    Commercial alternative to Docker Enterprise Edition.

    Uses cri-dockerd like Docker.

    Refer to MCR Deployment Guide for setup.

📌 Key Reminders for Exam

    Post v1.24: Dockershim is removed → use containerd, CRI-O, or Docker with cri-dockerd.

    Container runtimes must support CRI v1 (esp. from v1.26+).

    IPv4 forwarding must be enabled unless your CNI does it.

    Always match the cgroup driver (systemd is preferred).

    If changing cgroup driver → best to recreate the node.

    Configure the pause image (sandbox_image) in runtime config.

📚 Easy Example Summary

Runtime	Default CRI Socket	Cgroup Driver	Pause Image Config

containerd	/run/containerd/containerd.sock	systemd	config.toml → sandbox_image = ...

CRI-O	/var/run/crio/crio.sock	systemd	crio.conf → pause_image = ...

Docker Engine	/run/cri-dockerd.sock	Manual	via --pod-infra-container-image=... argument

MCR	Check cri-docker.socket	Manual	Uses cri-dockerd like Docker


🧱 What is a Pause Image?

The pause image is a tiny container that acts as the "parent" or "holding" container for all the other containers in a Pod.

Think of it like this:

🧊 Imagine a tray holding different ice cubes. The tray = pause container, and each ice cube = individual container (like app, logging sidecar, etc.).
🧠 Why is the Pause Container Important?

Here are the main reasons:
✅ 1. Network Namespace Holder

    All containers in a Pod share the same network namespace (IP, port space).

    The pause container creates the namespace, and other containers join it.

    This ensures that:

        They share the same IP address.

        They can communicate using localhost.

📌 Example:

    A pod has two containers: nginx and log-agent.

    The pause container holds the network stack.

    Both nginx and log-agent get the same IP and can talk via localhost.

✅ 2. Stable Lifecycle Management

    The pause container is always started first.

    Kubernetes uses it to track and manage the pod's lifecycle.

    If an app container restarts, the pause container keeps running — so the pod's network stays stable.

📌 Why useful?

    Keeps the pod alive while other containers restart.

    Prevents IP address changes or reinitialization of volumes/network.

✅ 3. Shared IPC and PID Namespaces (if configured)

    It can also hold Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and Process ID (PID) namespaces.

    This allows containers in the pod to share memory or see each other’s processes.

🧪 What’s inside a Pause Image?

Not much! It’s extremely minimal. It just runs a process like:

```/bin/sh -c "sleep infinity"

Or does something like:

exec /pause
```
✅ Its job is just to exist and do nothing — but hold namespaces.
🔁 Can You Change the Pause Image?

Yes! You can override the default pause image used by runtimes like containerd, CRI-O, or cri-dockerd.

📌 Example:

In containerd:
```
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
  sandbox_image = "registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10"

In CRI-O:

[crio.image]
pause_image = "registry.k8s.io/pause:3.10"
```
🛠️ When Might You Change It?

    To use a custom registry (e.g., internal/private repo).

    To reduce pull time in air-gapped environments.

    For compliance/security requirements.
